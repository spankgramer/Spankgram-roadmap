# Welcome to Spankgram - the web3 social network for adults

Spankgram is a unique and innovative platform that leverages NFTs, ERC1155, and the lit protocol to create engaging and immersive user experiences. With features like NFT profiles, NFT follows, and ERC1155 publications, Spankgram is poised to become the premier destination for adults in the web3 ecosystem.

## Key features

- **NFT profiles**: Create multiple accounts and represent yourself with your very own NFT profile
- **NFT follows**: Follow other users and collect NFTs to prove your follow
- **ERC1155 publications**: Create your own NFT blueprints and define supply and rules for your publication
- **Encrypted secret content**: Share secret content that is encrypted and only accessible to certain users based on publisher configurations
- **Utility token**: Paddle, a utility token that can be used to make posts globally available and improve your rank in the leaderboard

## What's next for Spankgram?

I've got some cool stuff planned for the next few months. Here's a quick rundown of what I'm working on::

- **Notifications**: Keep users informed about activity on their profiles and publications (2 weeks)
- **XMTP Chat**: Integrate XMTP Chat, a decentralized messaging protocol, to enable secure and private messaging between users (3 weeks)
- **Subscription tiers**: Introduce subscription tiers that offer additional features and benefits to users who pay a monthly fee (1 week)
- **Spank/Paddle system**: Enhance the existing Spank/Paddle system to add more functionality and value to users (1 week)
- **Contract test coverage**: Increase the test coverage of our contracts to ensure their reliability and security
- **Video support**: Add support for video content, allowing users to share and view videos on the platform
- **Poll functionality**: Implement a poll feature that allows users to create and participate in polls within their posts
- **Improving details**: Continuously improve and refine the details of the platform, including the user interface, user experience, and overall functionality

## The future of Spankgram

I've got some ideas for the long-term future of Spankgram! Here's a quick overview of what I'm thinking about:

- **Gasless Meta Transactions**: Implement gasless meta transactions to make it easier and cheaper for users to interact with the platform
- **Profit sharing communities**: Create profit sharing communities for creators, as well as creator coins to reward and incentivize their contributions
- **DAO tools**: Develop DAO tools that allow creators to easily create and manage their own decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
- **Composable communities**: Generalize the platform to create a framework for building on-chain composable communities
- **Wizards**: Create wizards that allow users to easily create their own composable communities on the go

## Partnering with Spankchain

I think partnering with Spankchain could be a good opportunity for both of us, and I have an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. Here's what I'm proposing:

- **Upfront investment**: I'm asking for 36k upfront, which represents my own investment in the platform and the opportunity cost of not working on something else. I used a profit margin of 50% and a cost-plus pricing method to come up with this figure.
- **Budget**: I'm asking for 5k per week in budget to help me speed up the development of the platform. This will let me hire contractors and get more done faster.
- **Equity**: In exchange for the upfront investment and budget, I'm offering to give Spankchain 80% of the shares in Spankgram.

I'm also expecting Spankchain's help with marketing, customer support, and business strategies. I think a partnership with Spankchain could help accelerate the growth and development of Spankgram, and I'm looking forward to exploring this opportunity further.
